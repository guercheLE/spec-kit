**Branch**: $BRANCH_NAME
**Base Branch**: $BASE_BRANCH
**Dependencies**: ${DEPENDENT_BRANCHES:-None}
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Files Created
- Specification: $SPEC_FILE
- Implementation Plan: $PLAN_FILE  
- Tasks: $TASKS_FILE
- Summary: $SUMMARY_FILE

## Next Steps
1. Review and validate the specification
2. Execute dependency rebasing (if applicable)
3. Begin implementation following the task order
4. Coordinate with parallel features as needed

## Branch Management
- Current branch: $BRANCH_NAME
- Created from: $BASE_BRANCH
- Dependencies: ${DEPENDENT_BRANCHES:-None}

**Ready for implementation!** 🎯
